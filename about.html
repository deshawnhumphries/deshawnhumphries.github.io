                                I went to school and earned an associates degree in Computer Science.<br>
                                I went back to school and earned a bachelor's degree in Information Technology.<br><br>
                                When the smoke cleared, I ended up in the database world (Oracle).<br>
                                I have spent 10 years doing database development as a job.<br>
                                But I never lost my passion for Web Development, and continued to do it on the side.<br><br>
                                At this point in my career, I have decided to focus on full stack web development fulltime.</p>
